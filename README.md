# Vehicle Selector Application

## Overview

The Vehicle Selector Application is a web app that allows users to select a vehicle make and model year. Based on the selected make and year, users can view specific vehicle models. The app fetches vehicle data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) API.

## Features

- Select vehicle makes from a dropdown.
- Select model years ranging from 2015 to the current year.
- Navigate to a results page displaying the selected vehicle make and model year.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
